        product_name,
        price
    FROM dannys_diner.menu
    ORDER BY price DESC
    LIMIT 5;

| product_id | product_name | price |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----- |

FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s  
WHERE s.plan_id = 0  
GROUP BY YEAR(start_date) * 100 + MONTH(start_date),  
		DATENAME(MONTH, start_date)
